# CrashAnalysis
The project describes analysis and insights on the Crash trends dataset of the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The dataset includes distinct variables about the crashes that occurred from the year 2010 to 2016.  I have made two dashboards in tableau,  
-Dashboard 1 
- Crash Summary Report This report summarizes the trend of crashes in Cambridge on an Year by Year basis,
drills-down the monthly crashes for the highest crash-occurrence year. 
It also analyzes the relation between the elements involved in the accidents and the most affected objects in crash. 
From these reports we can understand the trend and check if the crashes are seasonal and which categories of vehicles cause accidents. 

-Dashboard 2 
- Crash Summary report The report is used for Street-wise analysis of the data. 
Here we can analyze, for each street, the intensity of crash-occurrences in terms of number of crashes and also analyze whether the busiest streets are also the most accident prone.
